Knowing when to branch 

Branching is useful if you want to work on a cloned repository 
and commit it onto git as you work on it.

new branches can be made before a push command allowing you to push 
them onto the new or other branches.

So why would you want more than one branch. Simply a central source 
to draw from if anything should happenb to the version you are working on.
