Pushing to Known Repo

THIS NEED TO BE DONE FROM THE GITBASH BEFORE YOU USE IT WITHIN VISUAL STUDIO
NOTE: you need speech marks around text if they make use of keywords

Navigating to the directory you wish to push
cd 'C:\Users\There_Are_Many_Paths'

Method 1 - > Your First Commit
 
git init
git add . #( full stop is used for all )
git status #(This confirms any changes)
git commit -m 'Push It Real Good'
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/KentuckyKernal/GitBashCommands.git' #(Only necessary on first commit of new repo)
git branch -m 'branchname' #( to name the branch you want to change or create, default is master)
git push -u origin 'branchname'

Method 2 -> working in a directory that is already set up

If you are in the directory for multiple commits a session the instructions will change
you will only need one line of commands :

git add .
git status
git commit -m 'Some Time'
git branch -m 'Some Branch' #(If you are changing the branch to commit to)
git push -u origin 'Some Branch'
