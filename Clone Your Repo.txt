** Note: You cannot push cloned files directly to git from the download file it has 
**	 a hidden .git repo file has been embedded into folder
**       The hidden .git file will still be present on the copied folder whilst in another file structure

**       You will have to remove the local repo before creating a new origin
**       You must only work on the cloned directory **

**       A simple method is to delete the .git folder in folder/subfolders
**       this can be done manually by changing properties (right click) of the folder to hidden 'Apply' 
**       then undoing hidden 'Apply', then selecting and deleting the .git files
**       Another method is to run from the cmd (see Removing .git Files)
