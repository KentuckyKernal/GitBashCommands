Understanding: directories are assigned to an url upon creation
Therfore we can drop some of the commands required initiate this relationship 

NOTE: you need speech marks around text if they make use of keywords

Navigating to the directory you wish to push
cd 'C:\Users\There_Are_Many_Paths'
 
git init 
git add .
git status
git commit -m 'Some Time'
git branch -m 'Some Branch' #(If you are creating a branch or overite an existing branch )
git push -u origin 'Some Branch'
