General approach & understanding

1. Commit to a working branch
2. and merge to default branch after a code review
3. Might be a good idea to have a rollback branch

If many developers are on a paticular project 
a branch each is probably in order, perhaps a branch per area of the application 

a branch per area is probably best for oversight concerns as development 
into other application could be faster. 


So far I am enjoting .NET integration with github 
makes the whole process effortless
