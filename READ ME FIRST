General approach & understanding

0. Commit coed base to be devloped to a branch called 'Start_of_dev@time-utc'.
1. When Development goals are completed -> Commit to a branch called 'remote_commit_to_merge'
2. Create a pull request -> review the new code -> merge to default branch called 'master'
 'The first step allows us to have a rollback scenario'

If many developers are on a paticular project 
a branch each is probably in order, perhaps a branch per area of the application 

a branch per area is probably best for oversight concerns as development 
into other application could be faster. 


So far I am enjoting .NET integration with github 
makes the whole process effortless.
Certainly beats entire directories of roll backs per development blocks
